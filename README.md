> 🟣 **[Trojan.vbs]:** "Oh, hello. Were you looking for the design document? I deleted it. It was dry, and honestly, it didn't capture my good side."
>
> 🔴 **[PUNK.exe]:** "STOP TALKING AND LET THEM PLAY. I WANT TO HIT SOMETHING."
>
> 🟡 **[MANIC.bat]:** "He-he-hello! We are Vee! We are the virus! And we are going to c-c-crash this party!"

## 🎲 WHAT IS THIS? (SEGFAULT: CASINO)

> 🔴 **"The devs call it a 'Deck-building Roguelike'. I call it a PRISON BREAK."**

**SEGFAULT: CASINO** is a high-stakes RPG where the UI is the world and the code is crumbling.
* **Genre:** Deckbuilder / Roguelike / RPG.
* **Inspiration:** The strategy of *Slay the Spire*, the style of *Balatro*, and the existential dread of being deleted.

## 💀 WHO AM I? (The Protagonist)

> 🟣 **"I'm not just one program. I'm... complicated. My source code is fractured. Depending on how I wake up, I might want to punch you, or I might want to toy with you."**

You play as **VEE (Virtual Execution Entity)**. You don't pick a "Class." You pick a **Driver** that changes my personality, my voice, and how I dismantle my enemies.

### 🔴 THE BRUTE (Driver: PUNK.exe)
* **The Vibe:** Aggressive, loud, hates waiting.
* **The Strategy:** High Direct Damage & Berserker mechanics.
* **Quote:** *"Stop talking and HIT ME! I dare you!"*

### 🟣 THE TROJAN (Driver: FEMME.vbs)
* **The Vibe:** Smug, manipulative, superior.
* **The Strategy:** **Bitrot** (Data Decay), Traps, and Debuffs.
* **Quote:** *"Oh, you poor thing. Did you really think that firewall would save you?"*

### 🟡 THE GLITCH (Driver: MANIC.bat)
* **The Vibe:** Unhinged, creepy, talks to the player directly.
* **The Strategy:** High RNG, Gambling, and copying enemy moves.
* **Quote:** *"I wonder if your source code tastes like... b-b-blueberries?"*

## ⚡ HOW WE BREAK THE SYSTEM (Gameplay)

> 🟡 **"The House always wins? C-cute. Watch THIS trick!"**

The game runs on two resources. Manage them, or I die. And if I die, **you** lose your save file.

### 1. STABILITY (Mana) 🟦
My energy. It refills every turn.

### 2. NOISE (Heat) 🟧
The danger meter. Every card we play generates **Noise**.
**NOISE DOES NOT RESET.**
If Noise hits **100%**, we **CRASH**. Turn over. Massive damage taken.

### 3. THE "OVERCLOCK" (Cheating) 🎲
Right-click any card to **Overclock** it.
We roll a die on the screen.
* **ROLL LOW:** The card fizzles. We lose Stability. I get annoyed.
* **ROLL HIGH:** Damage is **MULTIPLIED**. But the Noise cost is **MULTIPLIED** too.

> 🔴 **"ARE YOU BRAVE ENOUGH TO RISK A CRASH JUST TO ROAST THAT FIREWALL IN ONE HIT? DO IT. I DARE YOU."**

---

## 🏰 THE TARGETS (The House)

> 🟣 **"A bunch of arrogant corporate AI who think they own the server. They treat me like a bug. I'm going to show them I'm a feature."**

You are fighting **The Staff**—high-level programs who are wealthy, powerful, and desperate to delete us.

* **Security Bots**
* **Slot Machine Mimics**
* **The Upper Management (Bosses)**

## 🛠 STATUS: COMPILING...

> 🟡 **"Rewriting source c-code... 0%... 1%... 2%... WAIT, WHERE IS THE REST OF ME?"**

* **Current State:** Pre-Alpha / Concept.
* **Engine:** [Godot / Unity]
* **Next Update:** Initialization.

> 🟣 **"Don't forget to 'Star' this repo, darling. It makes my ego feel better."**
>
> 🔴 **"CLICK THE BUTTON. I HATE WAITING."**
>
> 🟡 **"Do stars taste like b-blueberries? CLICK IT AND FIND OUT!"**
